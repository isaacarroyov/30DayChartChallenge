# My contributions to the #30DayChartChallenge.
The 30DayChartChallenge is a data visualization challenge  created by @CedScherer and @dr_xeo (on Twitter).

Some charts are made entirely with a programing language (mainly R and Python), a design/illustration software (Adobe Illustrator), online resources for data visualization (Data Wrapper or Flourish) or a combination of all of them.

This project aims to explore creativity and tools conserning #DataVisualization.
